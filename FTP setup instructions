To have an active ftp connection available through which you can connect to another computer
connected to the same network, follow these simple steps:

1: Run 'sudo apt-get install vsftpd'.
2: Start the ftp service with: 'sudo service vsftpd start'.
3: Try to connect to the localhost to verify the ftp access with: 'ftp localhost'.
4: Enter the current computer username and password and verify that the connection is made.
5: To edit the config for the ftp server edit the vsftp.conf file by typing: 'sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf'.
6: To find the host ip address run: 'ip addr'. The host ip will be under your connected network adapter.
   (Both host and client must be connected to the same network)

NOTE: This method is to run the standalone client and not the server based client.
      When connecting to the computer running the ftp, open a file explorer and in the
      address bar type the following and by replacing the necessary information with the correct info:
      'ftp://Host_Computer_IP_Address'

                    or
      'ftp://Host_Computer_IP_Address:Port_Number'
      NOTE: the port number is usually either 20 or 21.
