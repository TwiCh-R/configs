# configs
A repository containing all of the config files and miscellaneous scripts that I use for Linux Mint 18.1 x64 bit Cinnamon.

Some of the scripts are written by me and some are only tinkered with to suit my current needs. Anyone is welcome to use the scripts on their own debian based distro.
