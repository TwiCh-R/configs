This is a quick and easy tutorial on how to create a flash drive (or a partition thereof) into a portable swap space for linux OS.
It has been tested by others on Mint and Ubuntu flavours and is being done by me with the Parrot Sec OS.

Step 1:
	Plug the flash drive into the computer.

Step 2:
	Open the partition manager up (gparted in my case). 
	A sample line depending on your drive number is:
		sudo gparted /dev/sdb

Step 3:
	Partition and/or format the flash drive here before continuing. If a partition is going to be used then you have to specify the partition's filesystem type
	to linux swap.
Step 4:
	Type 'lsblk' in to determine if everything worked.
Step 5:
	Type the following into the terminal and replace /dev/sdb1 with the partition of your intended swap drive.
	
	Create the swap partition on the usb drive's partition.
	sudo mkswap /dev/sdb1
Step 6:
	Activate the swap drive.
	sudo swapon -p 32767 /dev/sdb1
Step 7:
	verify that it worked.
	cat /proc/swaps
Step 8:
	Unmounting the swap drive.
	sudo swapoff /dev/sdb1

EXTRA:
If you want the drive to be permanent and to auto mount follow these steps.
Find the UUID of the drive.
Step 9:
	ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/
Step 10:
	Add the following to the /etc/fstab to automount the drive as swap.
	UUID=The_UUID_of_your_drive	none	swap	sw,pri=32767	0	0
